## Payloads Deliver us Shells

Within the IT industry as a whole, a `payload` can be defined in a few different ways:

- `Networking`: The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.
- `Basic Computing`: A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. Headers and protocol information removed.
- `Programming`: The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.
- `Exploitation & Security`: A payload is `code` crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.


# Anatomy of a Shell

Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a `terminal emulator`. Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:

|**Terminal Emulator**|**Operating System**|

|[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)|Windows|
|[cmder](https://cmder.app/)|Windows|
|[PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)|Windows|
|[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)|Windows, Linux and MacOS|
|[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)|Windows, Linux and MacOS|
|[xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/)|Linux|

In Shell:
#### Shell Validation From 'ps'
`tylapcheong@htb[/htb]$ ps`

```
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   4232 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
  11435 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
```
  
#### Shell Validation Using 'env'
```
tylapcheong@htb[/htb]$ env
SHELL=/bin/bash
```
